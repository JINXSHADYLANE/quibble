Hi,

You've stumbled upon _quibble_, a place of bite-sized game design experiments. It's like a long running meta project for me and my friends. We love games and our ideas quite often start their life in here. Later they sometimes grow into [bigger](http://qbcode.com) things, sometimes vanish from existance, but most often they linger here as stories, images, metaphores, sounds, characters and melodies. Feel free to look at [downloads](http://code.google.com/p/quibble/downloads/list) section and try something out. You can look at the [code](http://code.google.com/p/quibble/source/checkout) too if you're into that kind of thing, it's all open.
