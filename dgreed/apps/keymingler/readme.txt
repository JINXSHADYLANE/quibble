KTU GameJam '10 game: KeyMingler
---------------------------------
Short: This is typing-tutor type game which tries to deceive you by mixing up
keys and eventually forces you to learn different keyboard layout.

You have to save poor fishies from innevitable death by shooting barrels down
and reducing rate at which water is polluted. You can shoot falling barrels by
pressing a key shown on them, but beware, some barrels' keys have been
accidentaly changed. Fear not, for no specific reason you can still briefly 
see real keys - that's your chance. Try to bring down as many barrels as 
possible with minimum amount of keystrokes. Pleease save the fishies.
