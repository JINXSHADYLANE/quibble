Gamejam project: KeyMingler
---------------------------
Short: Typing-tutor type game which tries to deceive you by mixing up keys 
and eventually forcing you to learn different keyboard layout.

A 2D typing game where you have to try and help poor fishies from innevitable death 
by shooting barrels down and reducing rate at which water is polluted.
You can shoot falling barrels by pressing a cooresponding key shown on them, 
but beware, "some" barrels' keys have been accidentaly changed.
But fear not, for no specific reason, you can see old "real" keys for some time, 
that's your chance. Try to bring down as many barrels as possible with 
as least as possible keystrokes. Save the world (fishy  one) at least once.
