*** Urvas ***

An epic roguelike game made for
Ludum Dare 27 game making competition.

You are a mighty old wizard and have
performed many great deeds and adventures
during your life. Your greatest foe now
is the time itself - you forgot almost all
the spells you once knew and the hand of
death is on your shoulder. But there is a
way to step into existence beyond time!
You gather your last strenght and venture
into the Cave of Power. The journey there
cost you your last strenght. In fact, you
have precisely 10 seconds left to live.
You stand at the entrance, gripping the
Stone of Immortals, which sucks the
lifeforce of fallen enemies and pushes
your death away bit by bit.
