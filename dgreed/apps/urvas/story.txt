You are a mighty old wizard and have performed many great deeds and adventures during your life. Your greatest foe now is the time itself - you forgot almost all the spells you once knew and the hand of death is on your shoulder. But there is a way to step into existance beyond time! You gather your last strenght and venture into the Cave of Power. The journey there cost you your last strenght. In fact, you have precisely 10 seconds left to live. You stand at the entrance, gripping the Immortal's Stone, which sucks the lifeforce of fallen enemies and pushes your death away bit by bit.
