ludum dare 23 entry, theme - "tiny world" 

Platformer puzzle about our personal worlds.
Inspired partly by my previous experiments with sokoban 
puzzles, The Myth of Sisyphus and the Earth Day.

The music was procedurally generated by WolframTones.

Controls:
arrows to move, 
up or z to jump, 
r resets level (you will need it a lot)

All content (except engine code) was made in 48 hours.
