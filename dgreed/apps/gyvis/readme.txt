                    gyvis,
                a snake clone.

Life is simple. We seek happyness and accumulate
memories, while trying to overcome walls built by
ourselves. You can take the easy path, do nothing
and drift along endlessly or make your own choices
and chase dreams until you hit some foolish
decision from the past. Both choices are equally
pointless!

Game is controlled by arrow keys. You can't win
and there is no score. 

Gyvis was done in an evening, as a test of C++
wrapper for my game framework. Source code can be
found in code.google.com/p/quibble. Music is by
