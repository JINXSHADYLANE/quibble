sausra - a dry platformer.

This is my reminiscence of the older times, when games 
were simple and gamers were patient.

Controls - left/right arrows for movement, z or up
arrow for jumping. Yes, it's supposed to be that 
fast and slippery!

Game was done in a weekend, using brand new Lua layer
on top of my game codebase. Source code can be found at
