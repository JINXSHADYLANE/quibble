A game hacked together in 48 hours, during Global Game Jam '11 in Kaunas,
then made suitable for use by general public after a week of polishing.

Navigate a high-tech robot with arrow keys and get him out of a dark 
factory warehouse style labyrinth. While light bulb shines you are able 
to see around and creepy creeps stays away from you. But keep an eye 
for fresh batteries because only light will provide a guidance for you...
